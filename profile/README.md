## ✅ Getting Started

### Create a GitHub Account
If you don’t already have one, sign up at https://github.com and send me your GitHub username so I can add you to the organization.

### Explore the Starter Repositories
Check out the base projects we’ve provided for inspiration and ideas. Feel free to build on them, remix them, or use them as a launch point for your own concept.

### Tell Us Your Preferred Tools
Let us know what development environment you normally use (PyCharm, VS Code, etc.). If you need training or setup help, we’re here for you.

### Form Your Team
Meet other participants, talk through interests, and build a team.

### Start Hacking & Have Fun!
Dive into your project, experiment, build, break things, fix them, and enjoy the process.
This is a learning-first environment; ask questions, collaborate, and don’t worry about being perfect.
No one here is an expert, and no one expects you to be.

## 🧭 Coding Club Code of Conduct

We want this hackathon to be a positive, collaborative experience for everyone. Please follow a few simple expectations:

- **Treat everyone with respect.**  
  Be kind, patient, and supportive.

- **Respect ideas and perspectives.**  
  All skill levels and viewpoints are welcome, encourage others and avoid dismissive behavior.

- **Help each other grow.**  
  Share knowledge, offer guidance, and create an environment where everyone feels comfortable participating.

- **Keep communication constructive.**  
  Critique ideas, not people. Celebrate wins, big or small.

- **Have fun and build something you’re proud of.**
